          <h3>About Me</h3>
          
          <p>I graduated University with a Medical Laboratory Science Degree and spent most of my career working in the Healthcare sector. </p>

          <p>While working in a fast-paced, stressful laboratory setting dealing with potential highly infectious samples, there has always been a part of me that finds coding to be a quiet, almost soothing activity, especially when you accidentally enter into an infinite loop that you have no way to break out of =P. Coding has been part of my life whether I consciously knew it or not. From the early days of programming my own Quadratic Formula onto the TI-83 to customizing reporting rules for a laboratory analyzer to working with Macros and setting conditions on excel, the ability to code has been with me every step of my career path. </p>

          <p>Now, it is the perfect chance for me to transition fully into the world of the Matrix... I mean Software Engineering and would love to work with all the great software engineers out there to create software that changes the way we live and improve it for a better tomorrow.</p>
